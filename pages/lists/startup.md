# Startup Toolset

These are the immediate problems when starting a startup or a business and so you need to be able to have at least 1 solution to the problem before you start. 


- Information Sharing 
  - Some way to make sure that all information is internally accessible (Notion, Paper Notes, anything.)
- Source Code Versioning 
  - **If** working with tech then this is pretty obvious but find something that's easy to onboard people to. Existing standard options are GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket
- Transaction Management 
  - This is absolutely necessary if you work with more than 1 person and you'd need something to keep track of the finances. You could do this in Excel or any other Spreadsheet software that allows simple aggregation formulas. Notion is a good option for this as well. 
- Asset Storage 
  - If you work with digital assets and you need to keep track of things that can be delivered, some place to store stuff will definitely help. Box, Dropbox, GDrive, 100s of options here but check what comes in your price budget and go with it accordingly. 
- Automation
  - This isn't a blocker for starting but will become one when you have a lot of mundane tasks that you do day to day and these can be avoided with simple automation solutions. 
    - Automate services: [ifttt](http://ifttt.com) or [zapier](http://zapier.com)
    - Automate Code Actions: Gitlab Runners / Github Code Actions 
    - Automate Simple code work: Python and JS scripts are a great way to simplify daily actions like scraping for reports or running system level stuff on triggers.
