# Work

This is a general overview of things I've worked on. You can also look at my
[resume]({{.Meta.BaseURL}}resume) for more details

## Domains

In the past I've worked with early stage startups and been part of core teams
more than once.

Business domains for the same:

- Medical Supply Chain
- Wealth Management and FinTech transactions (India Specific)
- Car Repair and Invoicing Systems
- Parking Management
- Scheduling,Filing systems for Taxes

## Namespaces

My online presence uses 2 namespaces, barelyhuman and reaper.

[_barelyhuman_](https://barelyhuman.dev) comes from my childhood interest in
aliens / extraterrestrial beings. The namespace is an umbrella for all my
community,research, contributions, and knowledge sharing

_reaper_ is a reminder that no matter how grim the job needs to be done. The
namespace holds anything that's tied to my personal work and my persona on the
internet. Just thought I wanted to use the work ethic similar to the _the entity
of death_ and that's it.

## Core Values

I adhere to certain non-negotiable core values. While I understand the
importance of protecting business implementations and USPs, I hope these values
do not pose any issues for you.

I really like to work with companies that:

- share my passion for Open Source
- prefer working remotely, since I'm a lot more productive in a remote setting

## Open Source / Contribution Requests

to take a look and potentially contribute.
