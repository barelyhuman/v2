The job market isn't a fun place for most people, I personally had a hard time
looking for one before I joined [NearForm](http://nearform.com) and the fact of
the matter is that it didn't matter what my resume had or how skilled I might be
cause I didn't even get a single reply.

I don't want to dig up what all happened but UpStash and Nearform were the only
2 replies I got from about 190 applications. I applied to every possible OSS and
Services company that I wished to work with.

Though, I did find a good website that I liked, fossfox.com (the link's now
dead) which provided 2 features that I really liked.

- Listed all the OSS companies that were hiring for roles
- Scheduled Newsletter of any oppurtunities that match you request.

The other things that existed were,

- No login
- Simple Straightforward UI

I probably would've posted a screenshot on twitter but I don't have a twitter
anymore so , that's that.

Anyway, fossfox just vanished into thin air so I'm not sure what happened, the
point of the post was that if something so well built was shut down because no
profit was being made then there's something wrong with what people consider as
an industrial product.

I don't have any energy to rant on such small feature complete apps just going
out of business because it's a problem with a lot of variables and a lot of luck
involved. Though, I'd like for someone to pick it up again and built it.

When you do, do send me a mail with the link to the app so I can help with
anything that I can, but for now, fossfox is dead and I don't like it!

Adios!
