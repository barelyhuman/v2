Announcing **Ping**, a simple no sign up solution for uptime notifications.

It's a micro app I built for my own use case but it's here for everyone to use. If you wish to understand why I built it you can read the [previous post](/writing/20240908-managing-uptime).

I don't have a 100 word short essay to describe what it does and doesn't do since it's a very tiny service and pretty self explanatory. 

The features were built to be non-intrusive and less irritating that existing implementations. 

And, well it's minimal.

Enough said, just go and
