A recent post from
[Manuel Moreale (On hobbies, side projects, and money)](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-hobbies-side-projects-and-money)
made me realise that the boundary between side project and hobbies in my case is
very thin.

While a lot of what I write comes with the intention of "I'm building it for
myself and it might help someone else out", the result of most of what I build
never reaches to the masses or not convincing enough for anyone to use.

This leads to a pro and a con

- I'm a developer who dabbles in _everything_
- I'm _just another_ developer who dabbles in everything.

It's also been brought to my attention that

1. Most people don't understand what I'm building when I'm working on random
   experimental projects
2. The one's they do understand is already built in a much better way by someone
   else.

I could justify both points but that is not what the post is about and neither
is it something that needs justification because it was built for me to begin
with.

But, and it's a big **BUT**; The things I do build for others (a.k.a
[dumbjs](http://github.com/dumbjs)) also end up not getting much attention for
the same reason and that does sometimes make it feel like the effort was not
worth it (and then I find something else that's fun to build and the cycle
continues).

The post and a tiny discussion with Manuel made it clear that at some point I'll
have to talk about money.

It's not hard to talk about money when I'm donating it to others but when it
comes to asking for it, I seem to freeze up.

Now since there's a minute context of what and where this is coming from, I'd
like to let people know about Manuel Moreale's One a Month movement for his
[People and Blogs](https://peopleandblogs.com) newsletter series and also that
my [Github Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/barelyhuman/) doesn't have
a minimum amount tier. It's been that way for ever and I would like to believe
that people aren't aware of it and that's why there aren't many sponsors (to
keep my sanity).

2nd part of this is for the OSS devs and users of their product/library/etc. If
you are a user and you think I'm not worth the $1 sponsor, you obviously have
free will and can choose to not sponsor but I'd like you to at least sponsor
someone who's work you are dependent on in the OSS circle. If you are an OSS dev
and are reading this, unless you are someone who's living off of the
Sponsorships, please do lower the barrier of entry for the donations so more
people can contribute financially.

End of the day, whether you contribute with code/money it helps the authors
realise that what they are doing is actually helping someone. It's
understandable that not everyone can help financially but I agree with Manuel
about $1 being low enough to set and forget.

That's mostly it for today,\
Adios!
