# One a month

[One a Month Club](http://oneamonth.club) is an initiative started by
[Manu](http://manuelmoreale.com) for his People and Blog series and a lot of
people have joined the initiative to create a non gated access to content
whether you support or not.

It's a tiny support system totally based on the kindness of people and so I
wished to be a part of it as well.

# How ?
